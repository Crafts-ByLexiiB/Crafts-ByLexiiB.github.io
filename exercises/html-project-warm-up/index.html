        <h1>HTML Project Warm-up<h1>
         Start off by adding an h1 element that includes the content "HTML 
         Project Warm-up"
Next, find a landscape oriented image from any online source, download it, and 
add it to your images folder
Be sure that the image file size is less than 1MB!
Include that image in an img element underneath the h1
Remember to include an alt attribute!  We expect ALL images to have alt 
attributes in this course
Add an h2 heading with the content "List of Inline Elements"
Next, add an ordered list element, with list item elements for each inline 
element you have learned about so far in the course, including the name of that 
element inside the list item
If you don't remember which elements are block elements, go to the HTML part of 
the Coding CookbookLinks to an external site. and filter by "Inline"
Add an h2 heading with the content "List of Block Elements"
Then, add an unordered list element, with list item elements for each block 
element you have learned about so far in the course, including the name of that 
element inside the list item
If you don't remember which elements are block elements, go to the HTML part of 
the Coding CookbookLinks to an external site. and filter by "Block"
Next, go back to the list items in the previous steps, and in each of the list 
items for the block and inline elements, wrap the name of that element in the element itself
For example, if you listed out "Bold Element", wrap that text in a bold element, like this: <b>Bold Element</b>
However, remember that void elements cannot have children or content inside them, so ignore this step for void elements
After doing that visit the resource page for the audio element in the Coding CookbookLinks to an external site.
Read through it, doing your best to understand the different parts and attributes that can be used on an audio element
Be sure to read the comments for best practices regarding audio online!
Then create a new "audio" folder in your "html-project-warm-up" folder, download this sample audio fileLinks to an external site., and move it to that "audio" folder
Add an audio element to your page
HINT: use the most basic example to keep things easy for you!
Next, visit the resource page for the video element in the Coding CookbookLinks to an external site.
Read through it, doing your best to understand the different parts and attributes that can be used on a video element
Then create a new "video" folder in your "html-project-warm-up" folder, download this sample video fileLinks to an external site., and move it to that "video" folder
Add a video element to your page, such that it enables autoplay but mutes the audio.
