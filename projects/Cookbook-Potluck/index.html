         <h1>Ingredients</h1>

         <li>6 or 12 slices white sandwich bread (use 12 if the bread is thin 
            and stack them in pairs; use 6 if the slices are thick)</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
             
            <ol>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.
            <li>If you're using thin white sandwich bread, use 12 slices and 
                stack two on top of each other to make 6 thicker pieces. Just 
                make sure the bread isn't too soft—something like fresh Wonder 
                Bread won't hold its shape well. If you're using a whole loaf, 
                slice it into pieces about 1.75 to 2 inches thick.</li>
            <li>Slice off all the crusts before moving on.</li>
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the melted unsalted 
                butter, honey, light brown sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. 
                Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then whisk really well 
                until it turns into a smooth, glossy syrup.</li>
            <li>Coat each piece of bread generously on all sides with the syrup 
                and place them on a nonstick baking pan—no parchment needed.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully flip each one and bake for 
                another 5 minutes until golden and sticky all over.<li>
            <li>Let them cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They’ll feel 
                soft right out of the oven but will crisp up beautifully as 
                they cool slightly. Enjoy them warm!</li>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1> 
         <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup walnuts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red chili flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</lli>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F. Spread the walnuts out on a 
                    baking sheet and toast for about 8 minutes, or until golden 
                    and fragrant. Let them cool completely, then finely chop. 
                    Set aside for later.</li>
                <li>While the walnuts cool, get your heatproof glass jar ready. 
                    In the jar, add the red chili flakes, salt, sugar, white 
                    pepper, and paprika and stir together.</li>
                <li>In a small pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat to 
                    350°F. Add the sliced garlic and fry until golden brown and 
                    crispy, stirring often so it doesn't burn. Use a slotted 
                    spoon to transfer the garlic to a paper towel to drain.</li>
                <li>In the same oil, add the finely chopped shallots and fry 
                    until deeply golden and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon 
                    or strain with a sieve over a heat proof bowl and set on a 
                    paper towel to drain.</li>
                <li>Once the garlic and shallots are done, strain the oil 
                    through a fine mesh sieve to catch any leftover bits. 
                    Return the strained oil to the pot and reheat it until 
                    shimmering and hot.</li>
                <li>Carefully pour the hot oil into the prepared jar over the 
                    spice mix. It’ll sizzle immediately — that’s exactly 
                    what you want!</li>
                <li>Once the chili oil has slightly cooled, about 5 minutes, 
                    stir in the reserved fried garlic, fried shallots, 
                    and chopped toasted walnuts.</li>
                <li>Let your chili oil cool completely at room temperature. 
                    Seal the jar with a lid and store in the fridge — it’ll 
                    last for weeks and just gets better over time.</li>
