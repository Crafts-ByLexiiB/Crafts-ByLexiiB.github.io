         <h1>Ingredients</h1>

         <li>6 or 12 slices white sandwich bread (use 12 if the bread is thin 
            and stack them in pairs; use 6 if the slices are thick)
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted
            <li>1/3 cup honey
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar
            <li>1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
             
            <ol>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.
            <li>If you're using thin white sandwich bread, use 12 slices and 
                stack two on top of each other to make 6 thicker pieces. Just 
                make sure the bread isn’t too soft—something like fresh Wonder 
                Bread won’t hold its shape well. If you're using a whole loaf, 
                slice it into pieces about 1.75 to 2 inches thick.
            <li>Slice off all the crusts before moving on.
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the melted unsalted 
                butter, honey, light brown sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. 
                Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then whisk really well 
                until it turns into a smooth, glossy syrup.
            <li>Coat each piece of bread generously on all sides with the syrup 
                and place them on a nonstick baking pan—no parchment needed.
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully flip each one and bake for 
                another 5 minutes until golden and sticky all over.
            <li>Let them cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They’ll feel 
                soft right out of the oven but will crisp up beautifully as 
                they cool slightly. Enjoy them warm!
