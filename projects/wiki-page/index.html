        <p>
          <p> Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,[2]
            or inter-crown spacing[3]) is a phenomenon observed in some 
            tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not
            touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
            [4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the 
            same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
            species.[6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that 
             it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]</p>

                <p>The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
                [6] The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature 
                since the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental 
                results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across 
                different species, an example of convergent evolution.
                [citation needed]Some hypotheses contend that the 
                interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning"
                 of adjacent trees: trees in windy areas suffer physical damage 
                 as they collide with each other during winds; the abrasions 
                 and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest 
                 that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by 
                 neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the 
                 crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, 
                 they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11]This explains instances
                 of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. 
                 Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly 
                 seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy 
                 forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession 
                 forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral 
                 movement.[6][12] According to this theory, variable flexibility
                 in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown 
                 shyness.Similarly, some research suggests that constant 
                 abrasion at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is 
                 unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester 
                 M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in 
                 eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips 
                 were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.[13] 
                 Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of Picea 
                 sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and Larix kaempferi (Japanese larch) 
                 suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the 
                 leading shoots.[10][14]A prominent hypothesis is that canopy 
                 shyness has to do with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. 
                 The photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a 
                 well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.[15] 
                 Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several 
                 unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the proximity of 
                 neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a task 
                 widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the 
                 phytochrome photoreceptors.[16] Many species of plant respond 
                 to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, 
                 encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the 
                 far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.[17] 
                 Similarly, plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance 
                 response, likely playing a role in the recognition of 
                 neighboring plants,[18] though this was just starting to be 
                 recognised in 1988.[19]The characterization of these behaviors 
                 might suggest that crown shyness is simply the result of mutual 
                 shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses.[
                 6][20] Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied 
                 Dryobalanops aromatica, suggested that the growing tips 
                 were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when 
                 nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.[6][20]
                A 2015 study has suggested that Arabidopsis thaliana shows 
                different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and 
                unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and 
                avoiding kin. This response was shown to be contingent on 
                the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.
                [21] A 1998 study proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-
                mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,
                [6][20] though a causal link between photoreceptors and crown 
                asymmetry had yet to be experimentally proven. This might 
                explain instances of intercrown spacing that are only exhibited 
                between conspecifics.[6][7]</p>
